<h1>100 Days, 100 Projects: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>100 Days, 100 Projects</strong> repository! This is an ambitious journey to explore, implement, and share daily projects covering a wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts. Each day brings a new project that dives into the practical aspects of AI/ML, including key algorithms, models, and real-world applications.</p>

<h2>üìö Project Overview</h2>

<p>This repository will feature projects across various topics in AI and ML, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Linear Regression (LR)</strong>: Fundamentals of supervised learning with simple to complex regression models.</li>
  <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Implementations of classification, regression, and evaluation techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Explorations into clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Neural Networks</strong>: Projects focusing on neural networks, including deep learning models and architectures.</li>
  <li><strong>APIs for ML</strong>: Hands-on projects to create APIs for model deployment and accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project is self-contained, designed to be completed in one day, with code and documentation for anyone to follow along.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies</h2>

<p>The projects will cover a range of tools and libraries, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong> for programming and scripting</li>
  <li><strong>Scikit-Learn</strong> for traditional ML models</li>
  <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong> for neural networks and deep learning</li>
  <li><strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong> for data manipulation and analysis</li>
  <li><strong>Flask</strong> or <strong>FastAPI</strong> for building APIs</li>
  <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong> and <strong>Seaborn</strong> for data visualization</li>
  <li><strong>Qiskit</strong> or <strong>PennyLane</strong> for quantum machine learning (as applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>üî• Daily Project Structure</h2>

<p>Each day‚Äôs project will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brief Explanation</strong>: An overview of the day's topic and goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Implementation</strong>: Clear and concise code for the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: In-depth explanations for understanding the concept and code.</li>
  <li><strong>Results & Analysis</strong>: Observations, insights, and potential improvements.</li>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong>: Additional reading materials and references.</li>
</ul>
