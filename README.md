100 Days, 100 Projects: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
Welcome to the 100 Days, 100 Projects repository! This is an ambitious journey to explore, implement, and share daily projects covering a wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts. Each day brings a new project that dives into the practical aspects of AI/ML, including key algorithms, models, and real-world applications.

üìö Project Overview
This repository will feature projects across various topics in AI and ML, such as:

Linear Regression (LR): Fundamentals of supervised learning with simple to complex regression models.
Supervised Learning: Implementations of classification, regression, and evaluation techniques.
Unsupervised Learning: Explorations into clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
Neural Networks: Projects focusing on neural networks, including deep learning models and architectures.
APIs for ML: Hands-on projects to create APIs for model deployment and accessibility.
Each project is self-contained, designed to be completed in one day, with code and documentation for anyone to follow along.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
The projects will cover a range of tools and libraries, including:

Python for programming and scripting
Scikit-Learn for traditional ML models
TensorFlow and PyTorch for neural networks and deep learning
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
Flask or FastAPI for building APIs
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Qiskit or PennyLane for quantum machine learning (as applicable)
üî• Daily Project Structure
Each day‚Äôs project will include:

Brief Explanation: An overview of the day's topic and goals.
Code Implementation: Clear and concise code for the project.
Documentation: In-depth explanations for understanding the concept and code.
Results & Analysis: Observations, insights, and potential improvements.
Resources: Additional reading materials and references.
